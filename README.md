# surfs_up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to provide investor W.Avy information about temperature trends Oahu, the perfect place for opening a surf and ice cream shop business. Using the weather conditions in a dataset stored in a SQLite database, I was able to provide W. Avy the temperature data for the months of June and December. In doing so, I provided him the information to determine if the business would be sustainable year-round.

  •	The temperature is averaging 71 °, having a minimum of 56 °, and maximum of 83.0 °.

## Summary
Results indicate the investment would be worth it in Oahu. The temperatures in both June and December are showing the weather being quite nice, both having the average temperature in the 70s. The data has shown to be nice year-round, but additional queries would further benefit determining whether it is a good investment and location for the surf and ice cream shop. One example includes accounting for the precipitation, allowing for determining the weather. Another example includes wind speeds. This would not only determine the quality of surfing, but would also aid in the optimal hours for the shop.
