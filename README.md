## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to provide investor W.Avy information about temperature trends Oahu, the perfect place for opening a surf and ice cream shop business. Using the weather conditions in a dataset stored in a SQLite database, I was able to provide W. Avy the temperature data for the months of June and December. In doing so, I provided him the information to determine if the business would be sustainable year-round.

## Results
